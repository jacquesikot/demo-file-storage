    "ahaMoment": {
      "value": "The critical 'aha moment' for Shopify merchants occurs when they make their first sale. This milestone validates their business idea, proves the platform works, and transforms them from someone 'setting up a store' to someone 'running a business.' Shopify has designed its entire onboarding experience to guide merchants toward this moment as quickly as possible, recognizing that merchants who achieve their first sale are significantly more likely to remain active subscribers and grow their business. The platform uses tools like Kit for automated marketing, educational content on making the first sale, and simplified setup flows to reduce time-to-first-sale. This focus stems from Shopify's understanding that 'not selling anything is one of the reasons that could determine merchants to churn' - if merchants don't reach their aha moment, they don't see the value and are less likely to renew their subscription. Secondary aha moments include: first repeat customer (proving retention), first $1K revenue day (proving scalability), successful omnichannel sale (proving unified commerce), and first wholesale order for B2B merchants.",
