## 3. Content Strategy

**Common Themes:**

- McCormick Place dry camping dominates as the closest RV parking option (under 2 miles from Grant Park, $30/day, 24/7 staffed)
- No on-site camping available at Lollapalooza; Grant Park festival grounds don't permit overnight stays
- Campgrounds 30-60 minutes outside Chicago offer full hookups but require commuting via car or public transit
- Hotel rates spike dramatically during festival weekend ($300-500/night), making RV rentals cost-competitive
- Public transportation (Chicago L trains and buses) provides convenient access from various neighborhoods and parking areas
- Early booking essential due to high demand from 400,000+ annual festival attendees

**Key Insights:**

- **Opening:** Competitors lead with basic festival facts; Indie Campers should open with the transformative freedom of combining Lollapalooza with a Chicago road trip adventure, immediately establishing emotional connection
- **Flow:** Structure should move from inspiration (why RV for Lollapalooza) → practical logistics (where to park/camp) → Indie Campers advantages (vehicle selection, unlimited mileage) → comprehensive planning (beyond the festival)
- **Syntax:** Use short 1-3 sentence paragraphs, bold key details like prices and distances, deploy H3 subheadings liberally (2-4 per H2), and incorporate bulleted lists for campground comparisons and vehicle features per vocabulary preferences

**Brand Differentiators:**

- Unlimited mileage on Indie Campers' owned fleet transforms Lollapalooza into a Midwest adventure (vs. mileage-restricted competitors)
- 8,000+ modern vehicles across wide range (compact to luxury Class A) vs. peer-to-peer marketplace uncertainty
- Airport-convenient Orlando pickup enables seamless land-and-drive for international festival travelers (63% of US business)
- 24/7 support and comprehensive resources reduce first-time RV festival anxiety

**Content Gaps:**

- No competitor adequately addresses international travelers' unique needs (airport pickup, vehicle preparation, Chicago navigation for foreigners)
- Missing comprehensive vehicle selection guidance (which RV size for groups of 2 vs. 4 vs. 6 people)
- Lack of extended road trip itinerary suggestions combining Lollapalooza with Chicago-area attractions (Indiana Dunes, Milwaukee, Michigan lakeshore)
- Insufficient cost comparisons showing per-person RV rental savings vs. hotel+car rental combinations for groups
