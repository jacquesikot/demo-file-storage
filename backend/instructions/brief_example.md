## 1. Audience & Intent

**Target Personas:**

- **Festival First-Timers:** Young professionals (25-35) attending their first major European music festival who need clear guidance on accommodations, logistics, and what to expect. Indie Campers provides the perfect intro to festival camping with easy booking, unlimited mileage, and campervan flexibility to explore Belgium before/after Tomorrowland.

- **International Festival Groups:** Friend groups of 3-6 people traveling from overseas (USA, Canada, Australia) seeking affordable accommodation with freedom to explore multiple Belgian cities. Indie Campers' start-anywhere, end-anywhere model with 70+ European locations enables multi-country adventures around the festival dates.

- **Seasoned Ravers with Comfort Priorities:** Experienced festival-goers (30-45) who've outgrown basic camping and want private space, comfortable sleeping arrangements, and the ability to escape crowded festival grounds. Indie Campers offers upgraded campervans with real beds, cooking facilities, and nearby camper sites within walking distance of Tomorrowland.

**Top Questions:**

- Where should I stay for Tomorrowland 2026 that's close to the festival grounds?
- What are the different DreamVille camping options and which is best for my group?
- Can I rent a campervan near Tomorrowland and where can I park it?
- How far is Boom from Brussels/Antwerp and what are transport options?
- What's included in Tomorrowland camping packages vs. renting your own accommodation?
- Are there camper-friendly sites within walking distance of the festival?

**Pain Points & Solutions:**

- **Pain:** DreamVille camping is expensive (€2,000+) with limited comfort and long shower queues. **Solution:** Indie Campers provides private accommodation with ensuite facilities, kitchen access, and unlimited mileage from €150-200/day, splitting costs across 3-4 people makes it competitive with premium DreamVille options.

- **Pain:** Festival tickets sell out instantly but accommodation booking windows are separate and confusing. **Solution:** Indie Campers allows flexible booking year-round with easy cancellation policies, giving travelers control independent of festival ticket sales timelines.

- **Pain:** International travelers want to explore Belgium/Europe beyond just the festival weekend. **Solution:** With Indie Campers' global coverage and start-anywhere/end-anywhere flexibility, visitors can pick up in Brussels, attend Tomorrowland, then continue to Amsterdam, Paris, or German festivals without returning to origin.

## 3. Content Strategy

**Common Themes Across Competitors:**

- DreamVille dominates as primary accommodation discussion with detailed tier breakdowns (Magnificent Greens, Easy Tent, Friendship Garden, Montagoe, Mousai options).
- Brussels/Antwerp proximity frequently mentioned as alternative city-based accommodation strategy 30km away.
- Transportation logistics emphasized - SNCB train discounts, Brussels Airlines partnerships, and commute challenges from distant cities.
- Campervans mentioned peripherally as "alternative option" but never fully explored as primary strategic choice with specific operational guidance.
- Post-festival recovery and extended Belgium travel potential rarely integrated into accommodation decision framework.

**Key Insights:**

- **Opening:** Competitors lead with festival history and hype; Indie Campers should open with the accommodation dilemma (expensive DreamVille vs. distant hotels) and position campervan as the third way that solves both problems.
- **Flow:** Move from problem (limited comfortable options near festival) → solution (campervan benefits) → practical how-to (where to park, what to book) → expanded value (explore Belgium). This structure mirrors customer decision journey better than competitors' chronological or feature-list approaches.
- **Syntax:** Use vocabulary preferences like "freedom," "flexible," "discover," "seamless" and "start anywhere, end anywhere" to emphasize autonomy versus rigid DreamVille or hotel booking structures.

**Brand Differentiators:**

- Only content positioning campervans as primary strategic accommodation choice (not afterthought) with complete operational playbook for Tomorrowland specifically.
- Indie Campers' Brussels hub 30km from Boom is perfectly positioned - competitors mention Brussels as city alternative but don't connect it to campervan rental opportunity.
- Global coverage angle for international travelers (70+ locations, three continents) enables multi-country European festival tours beyond single-event focus.
- Unlimited mileage removes the "hidden cost" fear competitors raise about rentals, enabling genuine exploration content.

**Content Gaps Indie Campers Can Fill:**

- No competitor provides actual camper site recommendations with booking links, distances from festival, and facility details - critical operational gap.
- Missing: cost comparison breakdown showing campervan rental split 4 ways (€150-200/person) versus DreamVille Easy Tent (€585/person) or hotel rooms.
- No guidance on campervan travel timeline: when to pick up vehicle, where to park first nights in Brussels, optimal arrival day before festival, departure strategy.
- Absent: packing list specific to festival campervan travel (different from regular camping or standard vanlife trips).
