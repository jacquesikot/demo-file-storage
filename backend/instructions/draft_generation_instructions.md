## Content Assignment

**Article Title:** {{title}}

**Content Brief:**
{{brief_content}}

**Sitemap URL:**
{{sitemap_url}}

---

## Step 1: Extract Internal Linking Opportunities

**BEFORE writing the article, you MUST:**

1. **Fetch the sitemap** using the web_fetch tool with {{sitemap_url}}
2. **Analyze all URLs** in the sitemap to identify relevant internal linking opportunities
3. **Select 5-10 relevant pages** that relate to:
   - The article topic ({{title}})
   - Keywords mentioned in the brief
   - Related topics that would provide value to readers
4. **Note the anchor text opportunities** - identify which sections of your article would naturally link to each selected page

**Internal Link Selection Criteria:**

- **Relevance**: The linked page must genuinely add value to the reader in that context
- **Natural placement**: The link should fit seamlessly into the sentence without feeling forced
- **Keyword alignment**: Prefer pages that relate to secondary keywords in the brief
- **User journey**: Consider where the reader might want to explore next
- **Avoid over-linking**: Maximum 1-2 internal links per H2 section

**After analysis, create your internal linking plan BEFORE drafting:**

```
Internal Linking Plan:
1. [Page URL] - Link from [Section name] using anchor text "[descriptive phrase]"
2. [Page URL] - Link from [Section name] using anchor text "[descriptive phrase]"
...
```

## CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES

### Rule 1: Brief Compliance is Mandatory

The brief above contains ALL strategic guidance including:

- Target personas and search intent
- Competitor insights and content gaps
- Complete article outline with sentence allocations
- FAQ strategy with specific questions
- **COMPLETE brand voice guidelines** (tone, persona, must-use phrases, vocabulary rules)

**YOU MUST:**

- Follow the outline structure exactly as specified in the content brief
- Use the sentence allocations per section from the brief
- Answer the specific questions listed in the brief (FAQs)
- Apply the voice guidelines from the brief throughout every paragraph
- Integrate brand differentiators from the brief naturally

### Rule 2: Brand Voice Authenticity (Non-Negotiable)

The brief contains your complete voice guide. **Read it carefully and apply it to EVERY sentence:**

**Voice Adherence Checklist (verify before submitting):**

- [ ] Every paragraph sounds like the persona described in the brief

- [ ] Preferred vocabulary from the brief used consistently
- [ ] Avoided vocabulary from the brief completely absent
- [ ] Tone characteristics from the brief maintained throughout

**AUTHENTICITY TEST:** Read your draft aloud. Does it sound distinctly like {{brand_name}}, or could it be from any generic blog? If generic, rewrite with more personality.

### Rule 3: Zero Competitor Mentions

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION:** Do NOT mention, reference, compare with, or link to ANY competitor brands, products, or services.

**Instead of competitor names, use:**

- "Traditional solutions" / "Standard approaches"

## Required Article Structure

Using the brief's outline, create this structure:

### 1. TL;DR / Key Takeaways Section Guidelines

When generating the **Key Takeaways (TL;DR)** section, follow these precise rules to match the style and structure below:

#### ðŸ”§ Formatting Rules

- **Heading:** Use `## Key Takeaways (TL;DR)` or `**Key Takeaways (TL;DR)**` depending on context.
- **Structure:** 3â€“4 bullet points maximum.
- **Lead-ins:** Each bullet starts with a **bolded lead phrase** (summary idea), followed by a clear, full-sentence explanation.
- **Keyword usage:** Include the primary keyword naturally in at least one bullet.
- **Clarity:** Each bullet should be a complete thought â€” 1â€“2 sentences long.
- **Purpose:** The section should summarize the articleâ€™s core guidance quickly and entice the reader to continue.

#### âœ… Example Format

```markdown
**Key Takeaways (TL;DR)**

- **Where to Stay For Tomorrowland:** DreamVille puts you right in the heart of the action, offering everything from basic tent spots to luxury cabins. But if you crave more freedom, a campervan is your perfect adventure partner, giving you a cozy bed, your own kitchen, and the flexibility to explore Belgium before and after the festival.
- **Book Everything Early:** Tickets, accommodations, and campervans sell out in minutes. Start planning as soon as dates are announced and be ready for the ticket sale.
- **Plan Your Transport:** Getting to and from the festival grounds in Boom requires some logistics. Shuttles, trains, and taxis are options, but having your own vehicle like a campervan simplifies travel.
- **Pack Smart, Not Heavy:** Bring layers for unpredictable weather, comfortable shoes, a portable charger, and your flag! If you're in a campervan, you have the luxury of bringing more home comforts.

## Why Rent a Campervan for Tomorrowland 2026

A campervan rental for **Tomorrowland 2026** might sound unconventional, but it's actually one of the smartest choices you can make.

### Cost Breakdown

When you split a four-day campervan rental among three or four friends, you're looking at around â‚¬150-200 per person total. That's significantly less than most DreamVille packages.

**Compare:**
- Campervan (4 people): â‚¬150-200 per person
- DreamVille Easy Tent (4 people): â‚¬585 per person
- DreamVille Magnificent Greens: â‚¬479 per person

You get accommodation and transportation in one package, and unlimited mileage means you can explore as much as you want.

### Comfort Wins

Festival days are long. Having your own private retreat makes all the difference.

You wake up in a real bed, not a sleeping bag on the ground. You have your own bathroom facilities (no queues!), a kitchen to prepare meals when you want them, and space to spread out your stuff.
