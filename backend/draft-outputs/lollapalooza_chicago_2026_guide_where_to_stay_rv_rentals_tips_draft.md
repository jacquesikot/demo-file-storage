**Key Takeaways (TL;DR)**

- **Where to Park Your RV:** McCormick Place Lot B offers the closest dry camping option to Grant Park—just 1 mile away—at $39 per day with 24/7 staffed security and convenient in-and-out privileges, making it ideal for festival-goers who want to minimize commute time. If you prefer full amenities like electrical, water, and sewer hookups, several campgrounds located 30-60 minutes outside Chicago provide a more traditional camping experience with pools, laundry facilities, and Wi-Fi, though you'll need to factor in extra commute time via Metra trains and CTA buses at all.
- **RV Freedom for Lollapalooza:** Renting an RV for Lollapalooza 2026 combines accommodation and transportation in one mobile package, eliminating the need to book separate hotels and rental cars. Indie Campers offers unlimited mileage on all their vehicles, which means you can freely explore Chicago's iconic attractions like Navy Pier and Millennium Park, take day trips to Indiana Dunes National Park (50 miles away), or venture to Milwaukee's breweries (90 miles) and Starved Rock State Park (100 miles) without worrying about extra mileage charges eating into your budget.
- **Cost-Effective Group Travel:** When you split an RV rental among 3-4 friends for a four-day Lollapalooza weekend, you're typically looking at $150-250 per person total—a fraction of the $1,200-2,000 per person you'd pay for downtown Chicago hotels charging $300-500 per night during peak festival season. Plus, you'll have your own kitchen to prepare meals, a private bathroom, and the flexibility to come and go as you please, making RV camping both economical and comfortable compared to traditional hotel accommodations.
- **Book Early:** With 400,000+ festival attendees competing for accommodation each year, it's crucial to reserve your RV and camping spot as soon as Lollapalooza 2026 dates are officially confirmed. Popular RV models and nearby campsites sell out quickly during Chicago's peak summer season, and booking early ensures you get the best vehicle selection, preferred camping locations, and most competitive rental rates. Indie Campers offers flexible cancellation policies up to 31 days before pickup, so you can secure your reservation with confidence even if your plans aren't fully finalized.
