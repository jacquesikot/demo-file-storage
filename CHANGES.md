# Changes Made for Coolify Deployment Fix

## Summary

Fixed the 404 error when deploying to Coolify by removing custom Traefik labels and letting Coolify handle routing automatically.

---

## Root Cause

The docker-compose file contained custom Traefik labels with environment variables like `${SERVICE_FQDN_FRONTEND}` that were **not being substituted**. Traefik received the literal string instead of the actual domain, causing all routing to fail with 404 errors.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `docker-compose.coolify.yml` ‚ú® MAIN FIX
**Changed:** Removed all custom Traefik labels, networks, and ports configuration

**Before:**
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.backend.rule=Host(`${SERVICE_FQDN_BACKEND}`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.backend.entrypoints=websecure"
      # ... many more complex labels
    networks:
      - claude-network
      - coolify
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

**After:**
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    # No labels - Coolify generates them automatically
    # No networks - Coolify manages networks
    # No ports - Traefik handles routing
    environment:
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:?}
    volumes:
      - brand-data:/app/backend/brand-data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
```

**Result:** Coolify can now properly generate Traefik labels with actual domain values.

### 2. `README.md`
**Added:** Quick links to Coolify deployment guides

```markdown
## Quick Start

### Deploy to Coolify (Recommended for Production)
See [COOLIFY_QUICKSTART.md](COOLIFY_QUICKSTART.md) for a streamlined deployment guide.
```

### 3. `backend/app.py`
**Added:** `/health` endpoint for container health checks

```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    """Health check endpoint for container orchestration"""
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "active_jobs": job_manager.active_count(),
        "max_concurrent_jobs": MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS,
        "version": "1.0"
    }
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Simplify Coolify deployment, remove custom Traefik labels

- Remove custom Traefik labels (causing env var substitution issues)
- Remove ports and networks config (let Coolify manage)
- Add /health endpoint for container monitoring
- Add COOLIFY_QUICKSTART.md and DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md
- Clean up redundant files
"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Coolify

1. **Delete old application** in Coolify Dashboard (if exists)
2. **Create new application:**
   - Repository: your-repo
   - Branch: main
   - Build Pack: Docker Compose
   - Location: `docker-compose.coolify.yml`

3. **Set environment variables:**
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your API key
   - `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS`: 3 (or adjust)

4. **Deploy**

5. **Configure domains** (CRITICAL):
   - Click on `frontend` service ‚Üí Set Port: `80` ‚Üí Set Domain
   - Click on `backend` service ‚Üí Set Port: `8000` ‚Üí Set Domain
   - Click Save

6. **Wait 30 seconds** then test your frontend URL

### Step 3: Verify

```bash
# SSH into Coolify server
ssh user@your-server

# Check containers
docker ps | grep your-project-id

# Test frontend internally
docker exec <frontend-id> curl -I http://localhost/
# Should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

# Test backend internally
docker exec <backend-id> curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy"...}

# Test externally
curl https://your-frontend-domain.com
# Should return: HTML content (not 404!)
```

## What Was Learned

### Problem
Environment variables in docker-compose labels were **not being substituted** by Docker Compose, causing Traefik to route to literal `${SERVICE_FQDN_FRONTEND}` instead of actual domains.

### Solution
**Let Coolify manage everything.** Coolify automatically:
1. Generates Traefik labels with correct domain values
2. Configures networks properly
3. Handles SSL certificates
4. Monitors container health

### Key Insight
When deploying to Coolify:
- ‚úÖ Keep docker-compose **minimal**
- ‚úÖ Configure domains in **Coolify UI** (not docker-compose)
- ‚úÖ Set environment variables in **Coolify UI** (not docker-compose)
- ‚ùå Don't add custom Traefik labels
- ‚ùå Don't add ports or networks
- ‚ùå Don't over-configure
